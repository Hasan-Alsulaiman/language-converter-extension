# language-converter-extension
converts the characters of input text to the charachters of different language as where a json file spicifes the mapping

this is still a work-in-progress! but you can easily adapt it to your need either by using the charachter mappings I provided or by using your own.
to use your own charachter map, simply create a json file of the mapping and place it inside the json directory
